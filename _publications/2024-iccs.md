title: "Adjoint sensitivities of chaotic flows without adjoint solvers: A data-driven approach"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-iccs
excerpt: "<img src='/images/image_2024_iccs.png'> We demonstrate the application of our data-driven sensitivity analysis framework on the computation of gradients of long-time averages of chaotic flows. We learn the parameterised dynamics of Lorenz 63 system and infer climate sensitivities by leveraging ensemble adjoint methods."
