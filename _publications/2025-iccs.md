title: "Data-assimilated model-based reinforcement learning for partially observed chaotic flows"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2025-iccs
excerpt: "We propose a framework, Data-assimilated Model-based Reinforcement Learning (DA-MBRL), to tackle control from partial noisy observations. The framework combines a predictive data-driven model of the system, ensemble-based data assimilation for state estimation, and reinforcement learning for control."
