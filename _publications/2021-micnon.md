title: "Regularized classification and simulation of bifurcation regimes in nonlinear systems"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2021-micnon
excerpt: 'We propose a multi-step identification approach to classify a nonlinear system into qualitatively different regimes and then estimate a low-dimensional subspace where predictions of the original state at future times can be obtained by simulation of low-order dynamics.'
