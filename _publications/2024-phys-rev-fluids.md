excerpt: "Adjoint methods have been central in gradient-based optimization but traditionally require known governing equations. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach that utilizes echo state networks (ESNs) to infer adjoint sensitivities from data, even in cases where the system's equations are unknown, or the data are subjected to noise. By embedding physical knowledge into the network architecture, the method accurately predicts sensitivities to parameters and initial conditions in a nonlinear thermoacoustic system. This framework opens new possibilities for gradient-based data-driven design optimization."
