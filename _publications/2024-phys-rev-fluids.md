excerpt: "<img src='/images/image_2024_phys_rev_fluids.png'>  We introduce a data-driven approach that utilizes echo state networks (ESNs) to infer adjoint sensitivities from data, even in cases where the system's equations are unknown, or the data are subjected to noise. By embedding physical knowledge into the network architecture, the method accurately predicts sensitivities to parameters and initial conditions in a nonlinear thermoacoustic system. "
