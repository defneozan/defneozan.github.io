collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2022-ieee-cdc
excerpt: 'We identify from data, the local dynamics around the limit cycle using linear periodically parameter-varying models. Using a coordinate transformation onto transversal surfaces, the dynamics are decomposed into two parts: one along the limit cycle, and one on the transversal surfaces. Then, the model is identified from trajectory data using kernel-based methods with a periodic kernel design. The kernel-based model is extended to also account for variations in system parameters associated with different operating conditions.'

We identify from data, the local dynamics around the limit cycle using linear periodically parameter-varying models. Using a coordinate transformation onto transversal surfaces, the dynamics are decomposed into two parts: one along the limit cycle, and one on the transversal surfaces. Then, the model is identified from trajectory data using kernel-based methods with a periodic kernel design. The kernel-based model is extended to also account for variations in system parameters associated with different operating conditions.
