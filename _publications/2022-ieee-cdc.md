title: "Kernel-based identification of local limit cycle dynamics with linear periodically parameter-varying models"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2022-ieee-cdc
excerpt: 'We identify from data, the local dynamics around the limit cycle using linear periodically parameter-varying models. Using a coordinate transformation onto transversal surfaces, the dynamics are decomposed into two parts: one along the limit cycle, and one on the transversal surfaces. Then, the model is identified from trajectory data using kernel-based methods with a periodic kernel design. The kernel-based model is extended to also account for variations in system parameters associated with different operating conditions.'
