collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2022-ieee-cdc
excerpt: "*IEEE Technical Committee on System Identification and Adaptive Control Best Student Paper Prize jointly with Mingzhou Yin* <br> <img src='/images/image_2022_ieee_cdc.png' width='300' height='300'> <br> Using a coordinate transformation onto transversal surfaces, the dynamics around a limit cycle are decomposed into two parts: one along the limit cycle, and one on the transversal surfaces. We then identify a model from trajectory data using kernel-based methods with a periodic kernel design."
