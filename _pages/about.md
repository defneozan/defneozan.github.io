I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/">Department of Aeronautics</a> at Imperial College London, where I am working on physics-aware machine learning (ML) for fluid flows with <a href="https://magrilab.ae.ic.ac.uk/">Prof. Luca Magri</a>. I am also part of the <a href="https://aifornetzero.co.uk/">AI for Net Zero in Energy and Transport</a> project as a Research Assistant.

My research interests lie in developing ML methods for the data-driven modelling, prediction and control of nonlinear dynamical systems. I am particularly interested in optimal control methods, currently exploring reinforcement learning for the control of chaotic flows from partially observed data.
