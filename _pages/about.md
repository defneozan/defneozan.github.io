I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Aeronautics at Imperial College London, where I am working on physics-aware machine learning for fluid flows with Prof. Luca Magri. I am also part of the AI for Net Zero in Energy and Transport project as a Research Assistant.

My research interests lie in the data-driven modelling, prediction and control of nonlinear dynamical systems. I am especially interested in optimal control methods, currently exploring reinforcement learning.
